      <p>Effective date: May 20, 2021</p>
      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your
        relationship with
        <a href="https://designvote.io">designvote.io</a> website (the
        "Service") operated by STOICA GEORGE OVIDIU PFA("us", "we", or "our").
      </p>
      <p>
        Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the
        Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance
        of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors,
        users and others who access or use the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the
        Service.
      </p>
      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
        ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
        periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a
        monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you
        select when purchasing a Subscription.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
        renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Designvote
        cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your
        online account management page or by contacting Designvote customer
        support team.
      </p>
      <p>
        A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to
        process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Designvote
        with accurate and complete billing information including full name,
        address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method
        information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically
        authorize Designvote to charge all Subscription fees incurred through
        your account to any such payment instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Designvote will
        issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually,
        within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to
        the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
      </p>
      <h2>Free Trial</h2>
      <p>
        Designvote may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free
        trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign
        up for the Free Trial.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free
        Trial, you will not be charged by Designvote until the Free Trial has
        expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled
        your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable
        Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any time and without notice, Designvote reserves the right to (i)
        modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel
        such Free Trial offer.
      </p>
      <h2>Fee Changes</h2>
      <p>
        Designvote, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
        Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
        will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designvote will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change
        in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
        Subscription before such change becomes effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change
        comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
        Subscription fee amount.
      </p>
      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by
        Designvote on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of
        Designvote.
      </p>

        through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity
        rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person.

        When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that
        is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so

        termination of your account on our Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access
        the Service and for any activities or actions under your password,
        whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must
        notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or
        unauthorized use of your account.

      <p>
        You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or
        that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trade mark that is
        subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without
